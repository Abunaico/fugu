# fugu HUD layouts

A layout is a YAML file. Its name is the file name: `compact.yaml` is the
`compact` layout. Built-in layouts live here; your own go in
`~/.fugu/layouts/`, and one there with the same name as a built-in wins.

```yaml
lines:
  - [fish, model, mode, ·, account, plan]          # one HUD line
  - context: [context-bar, context-full, ·, context-tokens]   # a labeled line
```

- Each `- [...]` is one line of the HUD, widgets left to right.
- `label: [...]` puts a dim label in front; labels in one file line up.
- `·`, `|`, `/` or any `"quoted text"` is a separator. It only shows when a
  widget after it has something to show, so it never dangles.
- A line whose widgets are all empty (no rate limits yet, say) is skipped.
- A name fugu doesn't know shows red as `?name`.
- When the terminal is narrow, lower-value widgets drop first, the same way on
  every layout. `/fugu:settings` switches (like `hud.cost=off`) still apply.

Switch with `/fugu:layout <name>` or `fugu-config layout <name>`. Make your own
with `fugu-config layout new <name>` (copies the active layout to edit).
`FUGU_LAYOUT=<name>` in the environment overrides the saved choice.
